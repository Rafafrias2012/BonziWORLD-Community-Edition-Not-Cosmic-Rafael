<p><h3>Chace's Guide to being an Admin on BonziWORLD</h3></p>
<p>If you want to be a good admin, you gotta follow this guide. Otherwise you might just be an admin abuser. Nobody likes admin abusers, y'know.
So if you want to be a proper admin, you need to read this before doing anything.</p>
<h4>Be respectful to others</h4>
<p>Nobody likes a mean admin. It's the reason why some people rather be in other servers, Admins being mean to others.</p>
<p>Try to be a nice person and treat everyone like your loved ones. Don't be mean to people, or you may lose your admin privileges.</p>
<h4>Don't give random people admin, pope or god.</h3>
<p>This is just gonna increase the risk of admin abusing.</p>
<p>Only adminify people who is someone Seamus trusts and is in the private discord server. If someone wants admin and has a username on discord similar to their username on Discord, they must require verification of their discord tag. If their tag isn't the one that is in the private discord server, immediately decline.</p>
<h4>Use the anti-warsaw tools against anyone who is breaking the rules</h4>
<p>If you caught someone breaking a rule in the rules page, they deserve a punishment.
Right click on the suspicious Bonzi, and go in the Anti-Warsaw Tools category, Use the kick or ban button to punish them.</p>
<h4>Don't sabatoge our server.</h4>
<p>If you're gonna be a good admin, you must not sabatoge the server. If you have no idea what that means, you have to look up the definition on Google.</p>
<h4>Limitations of being an Admin</h4>
<p>There are some limitations of being an admin. Here are some that most people know:</p>
<p>You can't specify the kick and ban reason. The time for bans can't be specified either.</p>
<h4>Actions you must use if you see a bonzi.lol supporter</h4>
<p>No one wants to see a person who believes in propaganda and fake news. As you may know already,
Seamus didn't actually groom people or spread CP, request CP, or anything thats illegal. He has never done crap like that. It's all lies spread by a scottish 15 year old who has no life.
If you spot a bonzi.lol supporter, use the hypnotize button in the anti-warsaw tools category. It changes their color to an accurate representation of a Bonzi.lol supporter.
If they continue to behave like a bad person, use the kick or ban function.</p>
<h4>Do not send the secret godmode password to anyone.</h4>
<p>This includes your friends, even everybody. Keep it to yourself and other admins.</p>
<h4>Don't punish randomly or out of nowhere</h4>
<p>Seriously. That's just admin abuse. Don't act like that. This includes kicking somebody for liking something (example: FNF)</p>
